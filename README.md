# Hangman Game 🎮

## Overview
This project is a basic Hangman game made with **Python** and **Pygame**. It was built as a group project to practice coding, teamwork, and game design. The game lets players guess letters to find a hidden word, with a stick figure drawn step by step for wrong guesses.

## How to Play
- The computer picks a random word.
- Players guess letters using the keyboard.
- Correct letters appear in the word.
- Wrong guesses add parts to the hangman drawing.
- The game ends when:
  - The word is guessed (win), or
  - The hangman is fully drawn (lose).

## Features
- Simple graphics using Pygame.
- Easy keyboard input for guessing letters.
- Visual feedback for correct and wrong guesses.
- Fun and quick to play.

## Teamwork
This game was created together as a group. Each member worked on different parts like:
- Word selection
- Drawing the hangman
- Handling user input
- Putting everything together

## Why It’s Useful
- Shows how to use Pygame for graphics.
- Teaches basic game loops and logic.
- Encourages teamwork in coding projects.
- Fun way to learn programming.

## Conclusion
Our Hangman game is a simple but enjoyable project. It combines the classic word puzzle with Python programming, making it both entertaining and educational.
